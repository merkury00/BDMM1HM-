    "As it was shown in classes, graph databases are a natural way of navegating related information. For this first project we will be taking a graph database to analyse beer and breweries!   \n",
    "\n",
    "The project datasets are based on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/beers-breweries-and-beer-reviews), released by Evan Hallmark. \n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you are working in the Data Management department of Analytics company.\n",
    "Explore the database via python neo4j connector and/or the graphical tool in the NEO4J webpage. Answer the questions while adjusting the database to meet the needs of your colleagues.\n",
    "Please record and keep track of your database changes, and submit the file with all cells run and with the output shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore the database: get familiar with current schema, elements and other important database parameters. [1 point]\n",
    "2. Adjust the database and mention reasoning behind: e.g. clean errors, remove redundancies, adjust schema as necessary. Visualize the final version of database schema. [4 points]\n",

    "    1. How many reviews has the beer with the most reviews?\n",
    "    2. Which three users wrote the most reviews about beers?\n",

    "    4. Which top three breweries produce the largest variety of beer styles?\n",
    "    5. Which country produces the most beer styles?\n",
    "4. Market Analysis department in your company accesses and updates the trends data on the daily basis. Given that, consider how you need to optimize the database and its performance so that the following queries are efficient. Measure performance to communicate your improvements using PROFILE before final query. Answer the following: [4 points]\n",

    "    1. Which two countries are most similiar when it comes to their top five most produced Beer styles?\n",

    "    4. Which user is the most influential when it comes to reviews of distinct beers by style?\n",
